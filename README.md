# coding-quiz

## Description
This challenge was a *Job-seeking coding assessments* or *take-home assignments*. These type of challenges do not provide a starter code, instead a code is built from scratch. This challenge was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The user is a coding boot camp student who wants to take the timed quiz "Brooke's Bucket List Quiz" with the abiilty to see their score history, so they can guage how well they know Brooke's Bucket. Challenge 4 was useful, because a typical coding assessment is part of the job interview process and may include both mulitple-choice and interactive coding challenges. However, I was not able to succesfully create local storage or hide or create a time interval for the users selected answer. This challenge was the most time consuming so far, but fun.
